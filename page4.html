        <h2 class="center">Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – 
            <br>What causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
        The types of risks one may encounter upon undertaking a digital project would be underestimating the time it takes to plan the project. The more time you take to plan the more focused the project can be, by being dispersed correctly to the right departments and people for the task. One also has to consider what they have in terms of resources, technology, people, schedules, time management, client expectations, and costing in delays to projects.
        In her blog(10) Ariana Harrison explains four risks to a potential digital project being “treating your first release like your last”,” not being engaged”, “not keeping your organisation up to date” and “not planning for post-launch”. 
    <br>
    <br>
        A digital project like a website will have to be constantly updated as would other digital based resources, partly because the information being presented needs to change, be updated, removed and amended, but also the platform that allows that, like HTML will have an updated version as its currently on 5 and this opens a whole other avenue of what the client expects from this and what can be achieved as well as being trained on the changes.
        She states that their needs to be a focal point of contact that makes the decisions needed, promptly and by doing this its best focused for time management.

    <br>
        In keeping things constantly moving and updated this would entail up to date technology that the client would want, having the right digital resources and upto date training on the newest tech software.
        Finally, she states that underestimating the post launch as “holding regular updates to keep internal executives in the know helps foster buy-in, gracefully pivot, and keep the project on track.”(11)
    <br>
    <br>      
        Having the client trained on the package allows them to navigate what’s needed along with the post-launch of maintaining the site, security updates etc.
