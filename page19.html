        <h1>Unit 2 1.6</h1>

        <h2 class="center">Describing access issues that need taking into account -
            <br>
            Describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                There are many different types of disabilities and learning difficulties that could affect the using of webpages like, blindness, deaf and hearing impaired, wheelchair bound
                <br>
                <br>
                In the website “3 free Tools for Visually-Impaired and blind people to Browse the Web”(23)
                <br>
                <br>
                The writer suggests ways to overcome this with the help of aides like ‘built in magnifiers in browsers’ that allow for text to be read more easily by increasing the font sizes. Installing NVDA (Non-visual desk access) “It will read everything your mouse hovers over and whatever you type”(24)
                <br>
                <br>
                Also having captions and subtitles on video player sites like YouTube makes it more accessible.
                <br>
                <br>
                There’s also a browser called WebbIE that allows “blind people that simplifies the Web by only fetching text and translating other content into text such as links, starting and ending points, fonts, etc”(25)
                <br>
                <br>
                Website publishers can implement these into their sites and consider them whilst they are in the planning stage so its more user friendly for people with different abilities as this is a large and ever growing market as of 2012 an “estimated one billion people with disabilities across the world.”(26)

                These people are internet users and customers who need access to IT solutions.
