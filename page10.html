        <h1>2.3</h1>

        <h2 class="center">2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? 
            </h2>

        <div class="box-1">
                I am happy with parts of my website as there’s always things you want to add and are not able to as I am still learning how to code in into Visual Studio, what the codes are as theres a vast array of what to do. Once I had finished my questions for unit 1 outcome 1 the formatting, adding styling, images etc took a long time to do and it was a case of limiting what I had envisioned as there wasn’t enough time to incorporate everything I wanted. Looking at a professionally created website I wanted the same aesthetic feel but only just starting I had to make do with what I could implement within the timeframe given. I do enjoy that I was able to put my personality towards the website by adding humour and levity with the pictures and gifs I added. Reviewing the website it looks promising, the content for the questions answered and research done is fine but theres little polishes that would make it more aesthetically pleasing. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I should have added more to Trello so I could keep a track of what I was doing and set myself a time limit so as not to spend too much time on certain tasks.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking back I would have spent less time on YouTube looking for codes and either gone on websites like https://www.w3schools.com which is very useful and asked for more feedback and help from others on Slack. The video clips took too long to search through and it was too time consuming and this wasted time I could have spent on research, styling, planning and improving the website.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is a functioning website with access to the questions, answers are visible and the ‘contact me’ section has details in there. So the information is there and theres styling and gifs which I am pleased with.
