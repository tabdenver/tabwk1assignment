        <h2 class="center">Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello         </h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                The IT tools I used were appropriate to the task because they were used in making and updating a website with stored versions uploaded onto a cloud storage system. As I was using a MacBook, Visual Studio Code was installed and that’s used to be able to create a website from scratch. I used this after spending time learning the basics of coding from using JavaScript which gave me an insight from a beginner’s level.
                <br>
                <br>
                VS Code had to be used in creating a website in conjunction with CSS - Cascading Style Sheets for the styling, fonts etc of the information in the index.html page that I created using VS Code.
                <br>
                <br>
                Trello allowed me to log and keep a track of what I was doing in terms of tasks in the sections of ‘To do,’ ‘Doing’ ‘Review’ and ‘Done’.   Slack was useful in sharing codes with people and seeing what they had to offer when I couldn’t find what I was looking for and when my code in VS Code didn’t work.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the end of the day I updated the versions I had created on GitHub which allowed me to save them online and in case my laptop was not working I would have been able to ‘pull’ them and continue without losing my work.
                <br>
                <br>
                I also used gifs and pictures to highlight what I wanted to convey in addition to the text which made it more accessible and user-friendly.
