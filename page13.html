            <br>
            could you have been more efficient when making your website?

            How?

Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

                The benefits with using IT tools and systems in terms of productivity and efficiency is that these are used by many people, so theres a wealth of information and knowledge about them. When I had a problem I could search the solution and get the answers from websites and video tutorials. This decreases the gap in knowledge and improves functionality. I could have been more efficient, but as its my first time doing so, it was all a learning experience. I should have looked at more websites to see how they layout theres, what I liked about them, what I didn’t, think about realistically implementing these on a beginners level and made sure I spent more time on planning for the website.

                Looking back on the experience having Slack made it easy to share codes and information so because of that it would have been easier to communicate in a team. I could have done this and delegated sections to people to work on like the different questions sections after giving people the answers to the questions and then say how I wanted it to layer out. There would have had to be codes shared as basic templates like the menu and navigating through the entire website, but specific sections needed different images adding which could have been done as part of a team.
