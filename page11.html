                If I had more time I would have loved to add in sound, change some of the fonts like the ‘Unit 1.1’ ‘Home’ sections, possibly have a picture or logo of a house to represent the ‘Home’ section and a telephone or letter symbol for the ‘contact me’ section. This would have been more universal without the need to know the English language as recognised symbols.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although I am happy with the Japanese  background, with some of the pages that have a lot of information, the background does not fit as you scroll down, a white background appears instead. 
                <br>
                <br>
                For section ‘Unit 1.3’ I would have liked to have an image or a gif of the Japanese Kanji for ‘Kanban’ to link that to the question of what a Troll board is.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would have liked the Beatles image inside the red box to be a second background that filled the lower part of the ‘Home’ page and not have the white background around it.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would have improved the sizing of the fonts for the links to the webpages to be much bigger and more readable as the size of 16 is too small I would have increased it to 35 instead.
