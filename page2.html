What you need to make digital projects successful; firstly we define what digital projects are.
</br>
There term digital refers to information that: “is recorded in binary code of combinations of the digits 0 and 1, also called bits, which represent words and images. Digital technology enables immense amounts of information to be compressed on small storage devices that can be easily preserved and transported. Digitization also quickens data transmission speeds. Digital technology has transformed how people communicate, learn, and work."(1)
</br>
<br>
Digital projects would then use that binary code into different ways of expression whether its software or hardware. What is essentially being done is presenting and communicating information in the form of data and research.
</br>
<br>
Having looked at a few job descriptions of Digital Project Specialist(2)(3), the common traits that come up are:
</br>
1.      Being strong at communicating and presenting information across different platform
</br>
2.      Have strong knowledge of software packages like Word, PowerPoint, Excel
</br>
3.      Strong interpersonal and analytical skills with an eye for detail 
</br>
4.      Confident in technology that allows them to communicate this
    </br>
5.      Working knowledge of that business sector; business to business sales, public sector health etc
    <br>
    <br>
In this blog about “What skills do I need to be a Digital Project Manager?”(4) the author has separate lists on what this constitutes ranging from the day to day tasks as mentioned of interpersonal and analytical skills to knowledge of; Copywriting, HTML/CSS, building relationships, interpersonal and presentation skills, the ability to adapt and keeping upto date with knowing technology terminology.
    <br>
The tools needed for this role are ones described for the importance and ‘purpose of IT in modern business’;
laptops, computers, servers, access to smart phones, web, apps internet, email applications.
        <br>
        <br>
<h3>What makes it successful?</h3>
This can be a subjective matter to a certain extent as understanding the content of the information that’s presented in a concise and focused manner would suit some people, conversely, engaging or even being humourous to others is regarded as acceptable. However, the over arching matter would be in “accomplishing a desired aim or result”(5) in this case conveying the information in the form of research, data or negotiation that the audience accepts what’s being presented.
