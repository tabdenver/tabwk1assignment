What you need to make digital projects successful; firstly we define what digital projects are.

<div>

        <br>
    
</div>

There term digital refers to information that: “is recorded in binary code of combinations of the digits 0 and 1, also called bits, which represent words and images. Digital technology enables immense amounts of information to be compressed on small storage devices that can be easily preserved and transported. Digitization also quickens data transmission speeds. Digital technology has transformed how people communicate, learn, and work."(1)

<div>

        </br>

</div>
Digital projects would then use that binary code into different ways of expression whether its software or hardware. What is essentially being done is presenting and communicating information in the form of data and research.

<h3>What makes it successful?</h3>
This can be a subjective matter to a certain extent as understanding the content of the information that’s presented in a concise and focused manner would suit some people, conversely, engaging or even being humourous to others is regarded as acceptable. However, the over arching matter would be in “accomplishing a desired aim or result”(5) in this case conveying the information in the form of research, data or negotiation that the audience accepts what’s being presented.
