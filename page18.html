        <h2 class="center">Unit 2 <br>
            1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2> 
        <br>
        <div class="box-1">
                Website copyrighting is a legal term where “All websites and their content are inherently copyrighted, provided they are original works”(20)
                <br>
                <br>
                Copyright is “legal right that protects the use of your work once your idea has been physically expressed. The current copyright legislation in the UK is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 … (and) needs to be original and tangible”(21)
                <br>
                <br>
                If I created my own original website that was to go live, without the possible infringement of the pictures, gifs and video clip that I have used without consent, I could include stock images and footage that’s free and paid for service instead.
                <br>
                <br>
                A company may not want me to use their pictures without purchasing it or their consent as it may be damaging to their brand in the context I use for.
                <br>
                <br>
                Whilst I was adding the pictures I was mindful of this, but if it were professionally done in a business environment for real then it may constrain what I wanted to present. I would have to factor in details like “Constraints related to technology, budget, deadline, etc. impact a lot while designing a website. Constraints are infamous among us as they take away our freedom through removing several options”.(22)
