                Ways I would have used in improving the productivity and efficiency would be spending more time planning what I wanted my website to look like and less time with experimenting. I would have had a plan and then spent the time focusing on that, making sure I got the basics covered and the website functioning first. After that I would have spent more time on CSS, styling and layout designs.Â 
                <br>
                <br>
                I would have spent more time on websites that tell you specifically what the codes are needed for as this would have saved me time.
