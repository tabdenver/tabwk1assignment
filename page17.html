        <h1>Unit 2  1.1</h1>

        <h2 class="center">Describing the content and layout for each page</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                There are some layout and content that I have chosen to have on every page to make it user friendly and consistent.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of these is I have links that open up separate webpages for ‘Home’ which is also the ‘About me’ section and then the questions and answers for Unit 1, Outcome 1 with the pages ‘1.1,’ ‘1.2,’ ‘1.3’ ‘1.4,’ ‘1.5,’ ‘1.6,’ ‘1.7,’ ‘Contact me’ etc This is in a red font it contrasts against the blue Japanese sky and is visible. With the exception of the Home page each answer box’s background has this picture. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Below this by a few centimetres indented is a red box on every page with black writing denoting the page, apart from the ‘Home’ page. This is the first header.
                <br>
                <br>
                Below this by 2 inches is a blue box with light teal font that has the question displayed and is the second header, apart from the ‘Home’ page, where it’s reverse. To differentiate it with the other pages.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have entered the answers underneath this in a see through box that allows the user to see the Japanese background with a red border. I chose this because it matches the red Toto and the pink Cherry Blossom tree and the red lettered links to webpages.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the rest of the webpages the colour scheme is used in contrast with blue headers and red banners and borders. I did this to highlight the difference in the ‘Home’ page to the rest of the pages and make it stand out.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first header on the ‘Home’ page has ‘Home’ written on it but this link doesn’t open anything. I did this to show it was the Home page.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the Home/‘Contact me’ page I put a gif from the movie ‘American Psycho’ as its funny and shows humour and creating a website allows me to personalise it by adding my interests.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started with my ‘Home’ page which had a heading and section ‘About me’ which was in a Heading format. This details who I am, some of the interests I have like film, The Beatles and why I came to CodeNation. It’s just a brief intro to get to know me. This was contained inside a box format, as were the responses to all the answers to questions. For this page the Japanese background is not the background as it’s white. This is because the image didn’t repeat as the webpage scrolls down. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Below this is a black and white picture of The Beatles at a recording session. I added this because I mentioned listening to them.
                <br>
                <br>
                The background was that of a Japanese jpg of a Toto with Mount Fuji in the back. This background was used in all of the webpages that opened separately above. I used this as it’s a beautiful landscape and somewhere I want to visit.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the bottom of the box is a Copyright text I wrote to show this functionality that’s displayed on websites. It says “Copyright ©2019 Tabraiz Khan” on every box at the bottom with the exception of the ‘Contact me’ webpage.
                <br>
                <br>
                The webpages 1.1 to 1.5  and the rest of the pages have the above layouts mentioned without the two pictures, the questions are indented and I have separated some answers into paragraphs, with numbered lists for 1.2 and 1.7.
<br>
<br>
                At the end of the answers I have created a space of one line and added a reference section with links to quotes taken from websites for pages 1.2 to 1.7 and below this added another line of space at the end with the copyright line.
<br>
<br>
                Page 6 for 1.6 has a gif of an animated Trello board that’s the same width as the background image. This has a brief description with captions on what Trello is.
<br>
<br>
                With page 1.7 ‘The list of 8 GDPR’ rules are separated with a line in between.  After the answer box there’s 2 gifs next to each other.  One is of phone with a lock logo and starts encircling it as a lock and unlock action is animated. Next to that to contrast is one man with GDPR written over him in black font continuously slapping another man, which I added because I thought it was funny and contrasted the seriousness of the other one. This probably insinuates the forceful nature of this new law enacted out.
<br>
<br>
                For the 'Contact me’ page in the red box’s header it displays black fonts of ‘Contact me’ with the red inside the box. The second header instead of displaying a question has my name ‘Tabraiz Khan’ in the same consistent font and blue background in the box.
<br>
<br>
In the see through red lined answer box it has part of my email address with some letters missing and “*” added for privacy, that indented into the middle with the copyright line that’s usually at the end of the box underneath this. Below this is another gif from ‘American Psycho’ with Christian Bale sarcastically saying “That’s great’ with white subtitles inside a see though white box, where the Japanese theme is visible. The background does not fit the entire page and there’s some white background overlapping.
