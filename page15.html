        <h2 class="center">Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work?

            Use of Slack?</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                I would have used Slack more for sharing codes on how to implement the website. I would have spent more time on https://www.w3schools.com rather than some of the YouTube videos I saw, as they were time consuming and I had to go through and search for the option I wanted. This took too much time and momentum was lost, looking at bite-sized coding websites and sharing them is more efficient and focused way of working on an IT project.
                <br>
                <br>
                Team work also would have saved time as I could have separated sections for people to look into for research like how to add an image, whilst I concentrated on the questions, other team members could have coded the sections using general templates that the website and index.html file would have. The general templating would have been codes for the layout and navigating the different webpages.
