            How does GDPR impact digital projects?<br>
            <br></h2> 
            <div class="box-1">
           GDPR stands for “the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA”)(14)
           <br>
           <br>
           This act came into effect on May 25th 2018 and means people in the EU and EEA have their data like “name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address”(15)  
           <br>
           <br>
           This is regardless of whether their data is public or private, allowing the public greater access and assurance in securing the protection of their information. This applies to companies that have data on people that want to sell to other businesses across the world.
           <br>
           <br>
           The 8 basics to this law are;(16)
           <br>
           <br>
1.      The right to request access to this information. 
<br>
<br>
2.      The right to be forgotten. If people are no longer customers of a company they can request to have their information like contact details removed from the businesses database.
<br>
<br>
3.      Data Portability right. The ability to have the data transferred from one provider to another.
<br>
<br>
4.      The right to be informed. This is when you opt in for your data to be gathered by a company.
<br>
<br>
5.      The right to correct your information, if the consumer thinks it needs changing.
<br>
<br>
6.      The rights to restrict processing. Which means the company can keep their information but not be used and left dormant.
<br>
<br>
7.      The right to object. People can stop their details being processed and used to be contacted.
<br>
<br>
8.      The right to be notified. If there’s a data breach the company has 72 hours to comply in notifying the consumer of this.
<br>
<br>
The type of influence this has on businesses is that it forces them to secure and respect the data of consumers and gives them more right on how it’s being used. Businesses breaking these laws can face fines of “up to 4% of annual global turnover or €20 million – whichever is greater – for organisations that infringe its requirements.”(17)
<br>
<br>
British Airways is facing a £183 million data breach fine(18) as a result of this law.
More money, time and resources would need to be spent on ensuring this law is adhered to and greater security and greater communication with consumers. Additionally, (https://www.coredna.com/blogs/general-data-protection-regulation argues that greater transparency allows the “companies that value access and use of their customer's data and treat it as a privilege, instead of a right, will help to solidify themselves as trustworthy businesses into the future.”(19) Turning this law, which some companies would consider costly and cumbersome, to manage the image of the business into a positive marketing tool.
