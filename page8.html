        <h2 class="center">Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
            E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                The difficulty in using IT tools to make websites is the amount of time you want to spend personalising your content to the time that is actually available. Programmes like Visual Code are so expansive with their compartmentalised sections like information and body of text being the html and then styling with CSS and adding other external sources like jpg and gif files.
    <br>

                Trello can be more simplistic in use as the general layout is already created with the Kanban but it allows you to customise the website content like the avatar, enabling colour blind friendly mode. Websites like Trello already have their function programmed by organising work in visual sticky note tasks. VS Code differs as you create your own website along with its functionality, and content from scratch.
