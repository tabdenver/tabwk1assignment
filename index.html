<h1 class="center">About me</h1>

</div>
<div class="box-1">

I'm Tabraiz Khan, but as that's unpronounceable for most people, Tab usually has to do.

<br>

I love movies and music, with a little bit of exploring and trying new things as I go along the way.

<br>

My favourite band is The Beatles and I tend not to trust people who don't like them.

<br>

Being brought up on foreign films as a child, I love films from China, Hong Kong, Anime and pretty much most things where subtitles needs to be read especially if the're competing about whos Kung Fu is superior.

<br>

I would love to travel around the world and I'm currently obsessed with Japan.

<br>

I came to Codenation as a recommendation to get a new skillset which could open up new avenues of opportinities.

Coding like Java, to me, is like learning another language via the use of a computer and software packages.

<div>

<br>

I love learning.

<br>

</br>

Whether its from YouTube clips or just by hearing people as it opens you up to experience more about areas I wouldn't have considered.
