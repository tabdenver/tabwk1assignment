<h2>Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website.

How will you plan it? 
Include a link to your troll board. </h2>

What you need to make digital projects successful; firstly we define what digital projects are.

<div>

        <br>
    
</div>

I would want to know what type of website I wanted it to be. I need to consider aspects lie the title, heading, body/content, theme, colour scheme, any animations I want to include, the type textual fonts I want. If I wanted a retrograde feel I could use Streamster(6)

<div>

<br>
What type of data do I want displaying?
This could be done with an already existing format and website that has been created and I would then amend details to personalise it myself as in my Trello account().
<div>
</div>
I will use my Trello account to plan settings up columns for tasks to be done using the Kanban method of visual columns.
(“A Kanban board is a work and workflow visualization tool that enables you to optimize the flow of your work. Physical Canberra boards…typically use sticky notes on a whiteboard to communicate status, progress, and issues.”()
<div>

    </br>

</div>
Kanban is a Japanese term for:
<div>
</div>
                    “manufacturing system in which the supply of components is regulated through the use of an instruction card sent along the production line.”()
                    
<div>
</div>                    
The Kanban board method in the Trello account is separated in columns of ‘To Do Things’, ‘Doing’, ‘Review’ and then finally ‘Done’.
<div>

    </br>

</div>
So as an example in order to get the basics of HTML programming I would say;
‘Things To Do’ is learn the basics of HTML. The ‘Doing’ task could be watching a YouTube video about it.
‘Review’ would be to consider what I have watched and look over any notes that I’ve made and ‘Done,’ would be once that is completed.
Trello allows me to make my lists public or private so others can view what I am doing or have done.
<div>
</div>
Alternately, I could decide to build a website myself, one that is not already pre-existing that just needs customisation. In order to do this I need to have knowledge of HTML; Hyper Text Markup Language and coding like Javascript and the presentation of HTML text in CSS.

<div>

    </br>

</div>

I will also need to have the necessary hardware like a laptop, a MacBook with software of notepad to copy and convert to the HTML, access to internet, If I want others to be able to use/amend/view the website.
Websites include www.wix.com and www.squarespace.com.
