        <h2 class="center">Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2> 
        </br>
        <div class="box-1">
                Like software testers that check for bugs for updates versions of games, I could employ people to test the website that I have created that’s outside of a team I’m in or not even in IT. This gives someone with a fresh pair of eyes the ability to use and test it out, like for example a member of the public, a certain demographic, just to check the user-ability and functionality of the website.
                <br>
                <br>
                I can test digital solutions by exchanging information on Slack to see if codes that didn’t work for me could be improved and ask for peoples feedback and improvements.
                <br>
                <br>
                I would check the website is functional myself. I would invite others to use it and take on board any comments, feedback and revisions needed. This would be a gradual process and constant updates and changes would be needed. I would have to narrow down what I wanted from the website and also how far I was willing to change the website and what IT solutions I would use; how much formatting and style do I want and how much was needed? I would have to set myself limits so I kept within a timeframe and kept to a deadline.
