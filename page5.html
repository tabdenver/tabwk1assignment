        <h2>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software
            <br>
            How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2> 
            <br>
            <br>

        Selecting the right type of technology be it hardware or software would depend on the task at hand, however, there are basic items that an IT systems department would necessitate for functionality.
        <br>
        <br>
        This would generally mean having communication hardware like computers, laptops, servers for storage and extraction for information and security, internet access, an IT department working in conjunction with a project leader for a focal point. The right software would be dependent on the project but generally a proficiency in website, coding and presentation would be needed like HTML, Java, CSS, Word and PowerPoint presentation packages.
        <br>
        <br>
        But the end purpose of the job is what the “IT Systems are adequate for, and operate and perform in all material respects as required in connection with.”(12)
