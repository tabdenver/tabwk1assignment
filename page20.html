        <div class="box-1">
                The appropriate file types for websites depends on the technology used and the type of website that’s needed whether its business, formal, informal etc as I would not want to use comedy gifs in a business website as it would be unprofessional and copyright§ legal issues would arise.
                <br>
                <br>
                As I am using a MacBook using the word document Pages would be used in coding the HTML file along with Visual Studio Code and CSS with additions like Flexbox is professional appropriate filetypes for the creating of a website. Websites will have images to showcase and one of the most widely used is jpg as it’s “JPG is perhaps the most common image format used on the web. It's highly compatible and boasts a small file size with very little noticeable quality loss.”(27)
                <br>
                <br>
                Which is something website designers should take into consideration with the download internet speeds and refresh rates of webpages adding to the loading of the page.
